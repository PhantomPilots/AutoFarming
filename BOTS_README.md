# AVAILABLE BOTS

All bots can be run from within the `Autofarming\scripts\` directory with a command that looks like:<br>
```python <SCRIPT_NAME> -p <PASSWORD>```
* `<SCRIPT_NAME>` will be the name of the file, for instance `BirdFarmer.py`.
* `<PASSWORD>` is optional, and it is your account password. If provided, the bot will automatically log back into the game if a duplicate connection is detected.

When farming the Indura demon, you can specify the fight difficulty like this:
* `python DemonFarmer.py -d chaos`<br>
It accepts `chaos`, `hell` and `extreme`.

You can combine multiple options, such as:
* `python DemonFarmer.py -d chaos -p myPassword42`

To see all available options for a specific bot, you can do:
* `python <SCRIPT_NAME> --help`

## Equipment farming script

A script that probably no one needs but me, `scripts/EquipmentFarmer.py` farms gear to extract blue stones while auto-salvaging whenever the equipment inventory becomes full. Then it goes back to farming. 

Requirements for it to work properly:
1. Have the "auto-farming" option of free stages set to 'infinite' with auto-renewal of stamina pots.
2. Have the desired farming team set.
3. Ensure the salvaging options on tavern-Diane are the desired ones.
4. Start the script already from within fighting an equipment farming free stage.

## Floor 4 of Bird

The bot we've all been waiting for: The automatic Floor 4 farmer, in `scripts/BirdFloor4Farmer.py`. It assumes the following team (with all the relics):
* Traitor Meli (recommended) / Freyr
* Thor
* Blue Megellda
* Shion (recommended) / Green Diane

Requirements:
1. **Important**: If you use Diane, place her on the rightmost position in the team.
2. 13M+ box CC (preferably).
3. Constellation 6 (preferably).

## Floor 4 of Deer

In `scripts/DeerFloor4Farmer.py`. It needs the following team:
* Thor (att/crit damage)
* Green Jorm (att/def)
* Freyr (att/crit damage)
* Green Tyr (preferable) / Green Hel. Both with (att/crit damage)

Start the script from within the Deer floor selection screen.<br>
**Note** that all units should have attack gear. The current expected win rate is of 60% with Tyr, 30% with Hel.<br>

## Hraesvelgr (Bird) farming script

It's named `scripts/BirdFarmer.py`, and it does what its name says: It farms floors 1-3 of the Bird uninterruptedly, even when stamina is depleted or a fight is lost.

Requirements:
1. Start by being in a screen that's in the path of going to the bird (i.e.: tavern, battle menu, or bird menu).
2. Have the team ready with the proper gear. This doesn't mean "saved" (this will be handled by the script automatically), but rather just set up before clicking the "Save" button.
3. **Important**: If using green/red Diane, place her in the rightmost position.

## Eikthyrnir (Deer) Floors 1-3 farming script

The script is named `scripts/DeerFarmer.py`.

<b>Update</b>: With the new Deer Floor 4, the bot has been updated to the new team:
* Green Jorm
* Freyr
* Thor Whale-mode 
* Red Megelda / Green Hel (recommended)

Other requirements:
1. Start the script from within the Deer floor selection screen.
2. Have the team ready with proper gear.

## Whale-mode Eikthyrnir (Deer) Floors 1-3 farming script

The script is named `scripts/DeerFarmerWhale.py`. It uses a very fast but risky strategy.

* Green Jorm (left) 1st slot
* Loli Merlin (center left) 2nd slot
* Freyr (center right) 3rd slot
* Albedo (right) 4th slot

Minimum Requirements:
* 16M Box CC

## Final Boss farming script

It's in `scripts/FinalBossFarmer.py`, and it accepts all difficulties. To change the difficulty, simply change the desired difficulty name in the script. It may default to either "challenge" or "hell", pay attention in which one you want:

<img src="readme_images/final_boss_difficulty.png" width="400"/>

## Demon farming script

In `scripts/DemonFarmer.py`, it's a script that looks for real-time demon fights in a non-stopping loop. It's an infinite source of demon materials without wasting any resource! It accepts any demon, from Red to Indura.
So far, it only accepts the "Hell" difficulty.

**An important feature** is that the bot will stop farming demons **at 2am PT time** to **check in and do all the daily missions** except PVP (unless the option is enabled, see below).

You can find all the setup options inside the file:

```python
FarmingFactory.main_loop(
    farmer=DemonFarmer,
    starting_state=States.GOING_TO_DEMONS,  # Should be 'GOING_TO_DEMONS'
    demons_to_farm=[
        # vio.red_demon,
        # vio.gray_demon,
        # vio.crimson_demon,
        # vio.bell_demon,
        # vio.og_demon,
        vio.indura_demon,
    ],
    indura_difficulty=args.indura_diff,  # Difficulty of Indura demon
    time_to_sleep=9.15,  # How many seconds to sleep before accepting an invitation
    time_between_demons=2,  # How many hours between each type of demon
    do_dailies=True,  # Do we halt demon farming to do dailies?
    do_daily_pvp=True,  # If we do dailies, do we do PVP?
    password=args.password,  # Account password
)
```

* To select the demons you want to farm, inside `DemonFarmer.py` uncomment (removing the `#` symbol) the lines for the demons you want to farm.

* You may need to play with the timing in the line:<br>
```time_to_sleep=9.15,  # How many seconds to sleep before accepting an invitation```<br>
âš  Lower than `9`, you'll risk wasting all your 3 daily demon invites.

* Doing the automatic dailies can be disabled by setting its option to `False`. PVP daily mission can be enabled/disabled accordingly as well.
