- **Farmer won't start**: 
  - Check that all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
  - Make sure your game is running and visible
  - Verify the game window can be resized
  - Sometimes the farmer takes a bit to start, be patient
- **No output**: 
  - Some farmers take time to start up
  - Check that your game is in the correct state
  - Try clicking the "CLEAR" button and starting again
- **Can't stop farmer**: 
  - The GUI will force-stop after 5 seconds if needed
  - You can also close the GUI window to stop all farmers
- **Window resize issues**: 
  - Make sure your game window is not minimized
  - Try manually resizing your game window first
  - Click the "RESIZE" button to manually trigger window resizing

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with Simple Farmers**: Try Bird Farmer or Deer Farmer first to get familiar with the system
2. **Use Infinite Mode**: Set "Clears" to "inf" for continuous farming
3. **Enable Dailies**: Check "Do Dailies" to maximize your daily rewards
4. **Monitor Output**: Keep an eye on the terminal to see what's happening
5. **Test Settings**: Start with default settings and adjust as needed
